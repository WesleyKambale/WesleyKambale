## Hey there! 👋

It's Wesley here.
==================================

Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist
--------------------
I'm a CS graduate with interests in a data career. I'm self-taught in data science and machine learning from DataCamp and Udacity respectively. I mostly deal with model development and deployment using TensorFlow into Web & Mobile applications.
I do data visualisation using Pandas and NumPY. I've applied these skills to some real-world projects such as:

1. [Rotavirus Outbreak Detection](https://github.com/WesleyKambale/Rotavirus-Outbreak-Detection)

This is a Rota-virus model developed to predict Rota-virus in children below the age of 5 through the wet and dry seasons.

2. [YieldUpp](https://yieldupp.herokuapp.com/)

Crop disease detection and crowdsourcing platform for farmers.

3. Enviro eWatch

A mobile application to monitor environmental degradation and restoration using image processing.

## Software Development (Web & Mobile) 
- Building RestFul APIs for Python (Flask & Django), developing and maintaining databases, hosting and maintaining application code in different hosting platforms (AWS & GCP).

- Using third-party APIs, plugins, SDK, and widgets in development.

- Mobile Applications with Flutter

- Cloud hosting, SSL installation and domain name routing, email configurations and configuring cloud apps, and using CDNs

## Start-Ups
I run a few start-ups in an attempt to invoke my entrepreuenrial skills and the desire to put forth solutions that can help make the world a better place.

1. [The Kreativ Duuka](https://kreativduuka.com/)

An online marketplace for selling and buying art & craft locally made in Africa.

2. [The Rwenzori Times](https://rwenzoritimes.org)

An online news site based in Kasese to share to the world the hidden stories of the Rwenzoris.
